Study of the different infrastructure organization tool available
    - Puppet
        + Built on Ruby
        + Node agent installation required
        + High numberof features


    - Chef 
        + Built on Ruby
        + Node agent installation required
        + Requires the installation of a workstation server to control the master node
        + Knowledge of git required

    - Ansible
        + Built on Python
        + No node agent needed, works exclusivly with ssh

    - Salt
        + new tool, quite buggy

Questions  
    - If I decide to use ansible or salt, in which language will the rest of the server code be in ?

Conclusion
    - Puppet/Chef more developpment oriented. 
    - Puppet has more features and is easier to get started with.

    - Ansible is more system management oriented.
