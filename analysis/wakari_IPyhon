    - 

Functionnalities
    - Terminal consol
    - Interactive shell Qt console
        + Graph displayed in the shell

        + Support code, texts, mathematical expression, plots 
        + Displayed in the browser
    - Parallel computing ( I didn't fully understand it's usefulness )

-- Wakari -- 

Description
    - Collaborative data analytic tool

Functionalities
    - Import datasets
    - Create, share and import notebooks 
        + Import and edit other people's notebooks
        + The environment is handled, no libraries problems

Usages
    I think using wakari may be beyond the scope of my thesis.
    
    The website as I imagine it is a GUI for the user to choose : 
        - The number of clients.
        - The type of requests ( ping pong, fixed string, random strings.. )
        - The number of websockets servers.

    Then the following graphs will be displayed : 
        - Bandwith in function of the number of requests
        - CPU usage in function of the number of requets   

    It would be great to retrieve the datasets generated in order to create a notebook.
    Notebook which would be customable by the users..
    I might consider it if I finish the rest of the thesis early.
    But for now I think it is giving too much importance to the interface.
    I would prefer spending this time analyzing and optimizing the load balancing and scalability on my implementation.
