- Server side implementation
    + Websockets general knowledge
        * Websockets technologies analysis
        * Implementation of a single websocket server
    + Server farm implementation
        * Infrastructure tools analysis [chef, puppet, ansible, salt]
        * Analysis of the most appropriate infrastructure regarding scalability and redundancy
        * Implementation of the script to deploy x nodes with the appropriate infrastructure
    + Server farm specific to websockets implementation
