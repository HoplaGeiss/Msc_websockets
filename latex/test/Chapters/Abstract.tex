HTML5 WebSocket protocol brings real time communication in web browsers to a
new level. Daily, new products are designed to stay permanently connected to
the web. WebSocket is the technology enabling this revolution. WebSockets are
supported by all current browsers, but it is still a new technology in constant
evolution.

WebSockets are slowly remplacing older client-server communication
technologies. As opposed to comet-like technologies WebSockets' remarkable
performances is a resulst of the protocol's fully duplex nature and because it
doesn't rely on HTPP communications.

The first part of this paper studies the WebSocket protocol and different 
WebSocket servers implementations. This first theoretic part focuses more 
deeply on heterogeneous implementations and OpenCL. The second part is
a benchmark of a new promising library. 

The real-time engine used for testing purposes is SocketCluster. SocketCluster
provides a highly scalable WebSocket server that makes use of all available cpu
cores on an instance. The scope of this work is reduced to vertical scaling of 
SocketCluster.
