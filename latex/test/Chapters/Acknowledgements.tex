I wish to thank my supervisor Mark Stillwell for accepting to work with me on
this project. His positive suggestions and willingness to repeadtedly meet and
discuss the progress of this thesis have been invaluable.

Naturally, I am also grateful for the continuous support of my family and of my
housemates. Always available and willing to provide either advises or
distractions.

Lastly I would like to thank my colleage L\'eo Unbekannt. Not only did he help
me in the very begenning when I was looking for a subject, but also later on
through the whole thesis. More importantly our daily lunch conversations
confirmed and raised my interest in computer science. Thanks L\'eo.
