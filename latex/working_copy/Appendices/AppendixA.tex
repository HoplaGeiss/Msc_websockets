\section{Simple ping-pong exchange}
\textbf{Client code}


This is an example of a WebSocket client code spread on all available cores.
New clients are spawned every \texttt{numberClientsEachSecond}. Thereafter,
every \texttt{intv} each clients sends a ping event cast to a Javascript JSON
object.

\end{figure}

To best simulate clients interaction with a websocket server, new sockets are
created at random intervals \texttt{intv = Math.round(Math.random()*5000)}.

\textbf{Server code}

The server listens for pings event and answers back with pongs event. In this
case the pong event is an integer counting the number of pings this particular
worker had during the whole experiment.

\section{File transfer}

\textbf{Client code}

In this example, the goal is to exchange a file using the WebSocket protocol.
For this purpose, the node.js \texttt{delivery} library is used.

New clients are created on the same model as the previous exmample. Each new
client is stored in the \texttt{clients} array. Each clients are also
perdiodically sending pings. The only add on is the \texttt{map} function to
enable the each socket to retrieve the document sent by the server.

\end{figure}

\textbf{Server code}

The server listens for pings. And sends back a file, \texttt{foo.txt} in this
example.
